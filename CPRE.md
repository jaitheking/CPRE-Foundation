1. Knowing symptoms of and reasons for inadequate RE  
    * Requirements are missing or not clearly formulated.  
        + If the requirements do **not** reflect customer wishes precisely  
        + If the requirements are described in an imprecise way

2. Knowing the four major activities of RE  
3. Knowing the role of communication in RE  
4. Knowing skills of a requirements engineer  
5. Knowing the three kinds of requirements  
6. Knowing the role of quality requirements
