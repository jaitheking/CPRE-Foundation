|**Requirement**| 1.  A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem/ achieve an objective.  <br> 2. A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents.  <br>3. A documented representation of a condition or capabilit as in (1) or (2). _[IEEE Std. 610.12.-1990]_|
|**Stakeholder**|A stakeholder of a system is a person or an organisation that has an (direct or indirect) influence on the requirements of the system.|
|**Requirements Engineering**|Requirements engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to the specification and management of requirements with the following goals: <br> 1. Knowing the relevant requirements, achieving a consensus among the stakeholders about these requirements, documenting them according to given standards, and managing them systematically.  <br>2. Understanding and documenting the stakeholders' desires and needs, they specifying and managing requirements to minimize the risk of delivering a system that does not meet the stakeholders' desires and needs|

Understanding the Educational Objectives:  

1. Knowing symptoms of and reasons for inadequate RE  
    * Requirements are missing or not clearly formulated.  
        + If the requirements do **not** reflect customer wishes precisely  
        + If the requirements are described in an imprecise way   
    * Misconception of the stakeholders that much is self-evident and does not need to be stated explicitly.  
        + Results in problems in communication among the involved parties that arise from differences in experience and knowledge.  
2. Knowing the four major activities of RE  
    * Elicitation  
        + Different techniques are used to **obtain requirements** from stakeholders and other sources and to refine the requirements in greater detail.
    * Documentation
        + The elicited requirements are described adequately and different techniques are used to **document** the requirements **by using** natural **language or conceptual models** 
    * Validation and Negotation
        + Documented requirements must be **validated and negotiated early on** to guarantee that the predefined quality criteria are met.
    * Management
        + **Requirements** management is orthogonal to all other activities and comprises any measures that are necessary to **structure** requirements, to prepare them so that they can be used by different roles, to maintain consistency after changes, and to ensure their implementation.                                  
3. Knowing the role of communication in RE 
    * It is sensible to agree upon a common language and how this common language is to be used such as using **glossaries**, in which all important terms are explained.
        + This can be done by agreeing upon a formal descriptive language, e.g., OMG's Unified Modeling Language, UML
    * Communication medium is an important factor to consider. The success of the communication relies heavily on redundancy for verbal communication whereas information is transmitted with a minimum of redundancy and feedback in written technical communication.
    * Problems arises from differing domain vocabularies and different communication media.
    * Communication is a language-based expression of knowledge which is necessarily simplifying in nature. 
        + Simplifications can become problematic with regard to requirements, as requirements can become interpretable in different ways.  
        
4. Knowing skills of a requirements engineer
      
5. Knowing the three kinds of requirements  
6. Knowing the role of quality requirements
