|Terms  | Definition  |
|-------|-------------|
|**Requirement**| 1.  A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem/ achieve an objective.  <br> 2. A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents.  <br>3. A documented representation of a condition or capabilit as in (1) or (2). _[IEEE Std. 610.12.-1990]_|
|**Stakeholder**|A stakeholder of a system is a person or an organisation that has an (direct or indirect) influence on the requirements of the system.|
|**Requirements Engineering**|Requirements engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to the specification and management of requirements with the following goals: <br> 1. Knowing the relevant requirements, achieving a consensus among the stakeholders about these requirements, documenting them according to given standards, and managing them systematically.  <br>2. Understanding and documenting the stakeholders' desires and needs, they specifying and managing requirements to minimize the risk of delivering a system that does not meet the stakeholders' desires and needs|

Understanding the Educational Objectives:  

1. Knowing symptoms of and reasons for inadequate RE  
    * Requirements are missing or not clearly formulated.  
        + If the requirements do **not** reflect customer wishes precisely  
        + If the requirements are described in an imprecise way   
    * Misconception of the stakeholders that much is self-evident and does not need to be stated explicitly.  
        + Results in problems in communication among the involved parties that arise from differences in experience and knowledge.  
2. Knowing the four major activities of RE  
    * Elicitation  
        + Different techniques are used to **obtain requirements** from stakeholders and other sources and to refine the requirements in greater detail.
    * Documentation
        + The elicited requirements are described adequately and different techniques are used to **document** the requirements **by using** natural **language or conceptual models** 
    * Validation and Negotation
        + Documented requirements must be **validated and negotiated early on** to guarantee that the predefined quality criteria are met.
    * Management
        + **Requirements** management is orthogonal to all other activities and comprises any measures that are necessary to **structure** requirements, to prepare them so that they can be used by different roles, to maintain consistency after changes, and to ensure their implementation.                                  
3. Knowing the role of communication in RE 
    * It is sensible to agree upon a common language and how this common language is to be used such as using **glossaries**, in which all important terms are explained.
        + This can be done by agreeing upon a formal descriptive language, e.g., OMG's Unified Modeling Language, UML
    * Communication medium is an important factor to consider. The success of the communication relies heavily on redundancy for verbal communication whereas information is transmitted with a minimum of redundancy and feedback in written technical communication.
    * Problems arises from differing domain vocabularies and different communication media.
    * Communication is a language-based expression of knowledge which is necessarily simplifying in nature. 
        + Simplifications can become problematic with regard to requirements, as requirements can become interpretable in different ways.  
        
4. Knowing skills of a requirements engineer  
    * Role : The one who has direct contact with the stakeholders and has both the ability and the responbility to become as familiar as possible with the domain and to understand it as well as possible as well as the one that identifies the needs underlying the stakeholders' statements and amends them in a way that architects and developers, usually laymen where the domain in question is concerned can understand and implement them.
        + A translator that understands the domain as well as its particular language well enough and also possesses enough IT know-how to be aware of the problems the developers face and to be able to communicate with them on the same level.  
    * Characteristics of a requirements engineer:
        + Analytic thinking 
            - Must be able to become familiar with unknown domains.
            - Must understand and analyze complicated problems and relationships.
            - Must be able to abstract from the concrete statements of the stakeholders.
        + Empathy
            - To have good intuition and empathy for people.
            - Identify problems that might arise in a group of stakeholders and act accordingly.
        + Communication skills
            - Elicit the requirements from stakeholders and to interpret them correctly and communicate them in a suitable manner
            - Must have good communication skills.
            - Must be able to listen, ask the right questions at the right time, notice when a statement does not contain the desired information and make further inquires when necessary.
        + Conflict resolution skills
            - Must identify conflicts
            - Mediate between the parties involved
            - Apply techniques suitable to resolving the conflict.
        + Moderation skills
            - Must be able to mediate between different opinions and lead discussions. This applies for individual conversations, group conversations and workshops.
        + Self-confidence
            - Needs a high level of self-confidence
            - Ability to defend oneself if strong objections to one's opinions arise.
            - Never take criticism personally.
        + Persuasiveness
            - An attorney for the requirements of the stakeholders
            - Must be able to represent the requirements in team meetings and presentations.
            - Must consolidate differing opinions, facilitate a decision in case of a disagreement and create consensus among the stakeholders.
           
5. Knowing the three kinds of requirements
    * Functional Requirement
        + **It is a requirement concerning a result of behavior that shall be provided by a function of the system.**
    * Quality Requirement
        + It defines desired qualities of the system to be developed and often influence the system architecture more than functional requirements do.
        + It is about the performance, availibility, dependability, scabability, or portability of a system. These requirements are frequently classified as non-functional requirements.
        + **It is a requirement that pertains to a quality concern that is not covered by functional requirements**  
    * Constraint
        + **It is  a requirement that limits the solution space beyong what is necessary for meeting the given functional requirements and quality requirements.**
        + It is not implemented but instead they are adhered to because they merely limit the solution space available during the development process.
